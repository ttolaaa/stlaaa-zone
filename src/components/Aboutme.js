                {/* <p className='paragraph-about'>
                    Hello, everyone! My name is Tola, and I am a female coder from Cambodia. I have a strong passion for coding and technology. I graduated as a software engineer in 2020, and since then, I have been working at cram schools in Japan as a developer and programming teacher. It's been an incredibly rewarding experience teaching young kids how to code and fostering their enthusiasm for technology.
                    Coding is not just my profession; it's also one of my favorite hobbies. I love undertaking small coding projects that enhance my daily life. For example, I've utilized ChatGPT to generate useful content, and I've created my own WordPress site to publish my work. Additionally, I developed a personal website specifically for tracking my daily food intake and weight, helping me stay healthy and accountable.
                    In my free time, I enjoy expressing my creativity through TikTok videos. I often share fun and entertaining content about my experiences traveling in Japan and exploring its culinary delights. You might find me as a playful kid in these videos, as I delve into the realms of cooking and even makeup.
                    As a female coder, I am passionate about promoting diversity and inclusivity in the tech industry. I believe that everyone, regardless of their background or gender, should have the opportunity to pursue a career in technology. In Cambodia, I actively support initiatives that encourage more women to embrace coding and STEM fields.
                    Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. If you'd like to connect or learn more about my work, feel free to reach out to me. Let's continue coding and making a difference together!
