                <p className='paragraph-about'>Nice to meet you! My name is Tola.</p>
                <p className='paragraph-about'>I was born in Phnom Penh, Cambodia 🇰🇭, my childhood was spent in a cozy small town 🏘️, and more recently, I embarked on my educational journey in Computer Science at the awe-inspiring Kirirom National Park ⛰️, perched majestically on a magnificent mountain in Cambodia. This was made possible through my enrollment with full scholarship at the first most esteemed boarding school <b><a href="https://kit.edu.kh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Kirirom Institute of Technology (KIT)</a></b> in Cambodia.</p>
                <p className='paragraph-about'>Currently, I'm employed as a system developer and programming instructor at a cram school in Tokyo, Japan 🇯🇵. In this role, I am responsible for creating web applications that enable students to reserve lessons online. Additionally, I develop mobile applications designed to enhance students' English vocabulary, aiding them in achieving proficiency in the Eiken test and I also provide scratch programming lesson to Japanese kids.</p>
                <p className='paragraph-about'>My curiosity drives me to acquire various skill sets ranging from graphic design, UX/UI, coding, and product delivery. Additionally, I find joy in reading and writing, having published a few books, including a scratch programming book available on Amazon Kindle. I have also wrote several series of articles related to lesson.</p>

                <p className='paragraph-about'>With a background in computer science, I have cultivated a strong curiosity and passion for understanding how people's motivations and emotions influence their actions. This intrinsic drive fuels my desire to explore and analyze systems, enabling me, as a designer, to conceive fresh and inventive ways of interacting with the world. I firmly believe in the transformative power of technology to empower individuals and enhance their overall experiences. Each day, I eagerly embrace opportunities to learn and draw inspiration from various sources, continuously evolving both as a programmer and a receptive listener.
